# Posture_Detection_Using_Python
 This python program detects human in the frame and estimates its posture.

What I have created here is basically an app which tells whether you are doing right yoga pose or not based on your pose detection algorithm using mediapipe library.

This app opens camera initially and if you are performing the right pose in front of it, then based on your angle calculations this tells your yoga pose. And if you are not doing it upto the mark then it doesn't counts that in correct pose.
This whole project is based on Python and its associated libraries out there.
